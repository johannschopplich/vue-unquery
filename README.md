> Lightweight asynchronous data management for Vue.

Basically an identical fork of [TurboVue](https://github.com/StudioLambda/TurboVue), but also suited for non-suspense setups. All the credits to [Erik C. Forés](https://github.com/ConsoleTVs) for his amazing work.

## Key Features

- Non-suspense usage via `useQuery`
- Support for lazy fetching via `immediate: false` option
